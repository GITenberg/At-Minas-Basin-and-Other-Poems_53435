<span class="i22">Twelve months agone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauteous face, all white with pity as<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wave with foam, sank in the dusk of death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four summers and the wafture of the fifth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had poured their cataract of gold far down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shining shoulders of the seraph boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While love, a father's and a mother's, hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above its laughter like a thing divine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O golden head that drifted down to death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet eye and voice by silence swift devoured!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dawn's kiss upon the forehead of the day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fresh-blown surge of grief was stilled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And halcyon hope her azure wings outspread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all the hollow sky on Easter morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was, like a lily, filled with golden light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift through the hush of death the thrill of life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touched the still chords of the fair mother's heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And woke unquenchable desire to lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White lilies from the darksome mother-earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the tomb, where circled, like a dove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wing&euml;d hopes,&mdash;the tomb where long ago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White angels watched the birth of Life anew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beside the lilied mound she lingered long.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her rising soul pushed at the gates of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, like a creek from which the moon has drunk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tide, they yawned empty and bare of hope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All spectral grew her heart with tearless grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As some sweet plot of lichens reft of rain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"There are no angels now," she said, "to roll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stone away. O that He now were here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To raise my dead, if 'tis not all a myth!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as she spoke she lift a bitter face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the eyes of the bright Easter day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not far away she saw a little child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of scarce five years, and drawing near she knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him one who never felt a mother's kiss,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now sitting at the grave where one long month<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had slept his father,&mdash;kith nor kin bequeathed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boy in the wide circle of the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She knew that, rose and rosebud on one stem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father and child had crimsoned life with love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that the wind of death had snatched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rose and left the unsheltered bud alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet blinded by the night of her own grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce had she seen his golden day's eclipse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now swift she marked the tender mobile lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirit-light aglow in eye, on brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rare beauty of the noble face.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Is your name Mary," fearlessly he asked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Who with the angels talked when the great stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was rolled away?&mdash;" "O no, dear child," she said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Whom are you looking for?" With reverent mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet eager voice, "For Jesus," said the child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Jesus is not here, my darling boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's risen, you know." "Yes," said the wistful face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I've waited here all day for Him to come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raise my father up. I thought perhaps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sent you, 'tis so late, to bid me stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little&mdash;O 'tis never too late for<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jesus!" he said, and brushed away the tear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He's sure to come, for 'tis the Rising-Day."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The woman stoopt to kiss the wondrous boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sat beside him there upon the grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sobbed like organ swept by the master's hand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What makes you cry?&mdash;perhaps your father's here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be raised up?" "No darling,&mdash;but my child."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stroked the woman's hand: "Don't cry," he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Jesus does not forget the Rising-Day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'll surely come and give to you your child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And me my father&mdash;He will come to-night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the two men who from Emmaus came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go by at early morn, and Jesus will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meet them, and turn and this way come, as they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wonder all about His dying talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rising too. The men will know Him not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I shall, and will call to Him to stop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raise my father up." "How shall you know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him, my dear boy?" she asked. "O by His smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the picture father shewed me once,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But" (with his hand upon his heaving breast)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'll know Him best by the love I keep in here."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Shall you?" she said, "and are you sure you'll know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your father?" "My own father!" said the boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wondering voice, "I'll know him by the love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so will you your child. They will not look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same, for Jesus did not, but they knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him by His love." And finer grew the face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the fond lingering voice, in love's own tones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repeated: "And we'll know them by the love."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Moveless a moment, as the tide at full,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her heart hung in a balance, and as its<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tremulous deeps swayed to the signs of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its wave broke o'er the banks of self to life.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Philip," she cried, and clasped him in her arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Jesus has gone to heaven, and I am sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Him to take you to your father now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come!" With faith strong as is the noonday sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instant the child clasped home her trembling hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passed without the gates, nor backward lookt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent he went, for expectation held<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him fast, and a great light was on her face.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Entering her home, she bade that food be given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The famished boy; and when the maid brought milk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honey and bread with broil&euml;d fish, he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With exultation: "Now I know this is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The house&mdash;it's all here just the same, and He'll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be here to-night." With wing&euml;d feet the wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sped up the stair to meet her husband's step,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a rapture told him all, and of<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wonder-heart below. "Heaven, a fair child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An angel boy, has sent our stone to roll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away! For us his vision is no less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than for himself. O husband, this is life's<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supremest hour for us!&mdash;'<i>I shall know him</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>By the love</i>,' sweetly he says."&mdash;"It shall be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So indeed!" cried the father's yearning heart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As she returned, the child most eager said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a sweet voice half-sob, but full of hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O wash my face and comb my hair, before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see my father&mdash;'tis not too late yet?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The touch of the ineffable child-trust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced deep her heart, yet with assuring tones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The words fell: "Philip, come, let us now go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">The arras opened on a face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noble and winsome sweet, though smiles were close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tears. As azure bird on mountain stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Halts a brief moment on some jutting crag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere as a flash of streaming light it cleaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dewy darkness of the trickling dell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So for a moment halted the sweet child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took one step forward, and then leapt into<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The arms where death-shade once was deep as night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But where commingling love now glads the gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All lit by the sweet azure of the heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With head thrown back, and questioning eyes agaze:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Father&mdash;you're&mdash;changed!" he said, "but by the love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know each other&mdash;by the love, the love!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The father's heaving heart did echo sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The love, the love!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">And nestling down upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The manly breast, the curly head, soft-stroked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soothed with all the lullabies of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was rocked, like harbored sail, to rest of sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lapt in the love which fed his simple faith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poured a golden Easter in the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her who groped in darkness 'mong the tombs.<br /></span>

<p>Page 17. <i>and erst "rose noble" bore thy grace.</i>&mdash;The
"rose noble," an ancient English gold coin, first minted
by Edward III., was stamped with the figure of the rose.</p>

<p>19. <i>The phantom of the buried tide.</i>&mdash;This phenomenon
is not infrequently seen in the evenings of the last of
August or early September. It is caused by the condensation
of the invisible vapor of the air resting on the
dyked lands&mdash;the former sea-bed. As the condensed
vapor lies close upon the ground, the illusion of a full
sea is complete in the moonlight, the shore line and
creeks being perfectly traced.</p>

<p>28. <i>The title deeds of these rich shores are thine.</i>&mdash;Geologists
affirm that Partridge Island is older than the
mainland, or than the other islands mentioned.</p>

<p>29. <span class="smcap">Tennyson Rock.</span>&mdash;This rock is the pinnacle of
Pinnacle Island (one of the Five Islands, Basin of
Minas). The rock is solitary, and nearly two hundred
feet high at low water,&mdash;a seated figure strongly resembling,
as seen from the Basin, Lord Tennyson in his old
age&mdash;with his cloak about him.</p>

<p>32. <span class="smcap">Glooscap.</span>&mdash;The divine man of the Micmac Indians.
His home was on the shores of the Basin of
Minas, particularly at Partridge Island, the Five Islands,
and Blomidon. He sailed away "into the west," because
of the wickedness of men and beasts, not to return till
they should heed his voice. (See "Legends of the
Micmacs," gathered by the late Rev. Silas Tertius Rand,
D.D., LL.D, of Hantsport, Nova Scotia, and published
by Wellesley College, Wellesley, Mass.)</p>

<p>40. <span class="smcap">Day and Night.</span>&mdash;The last three lines of the
sonnet refer to the "afterglow," which often appears (at
Minas Basin) from half an hour to an hour or more after
the first sunset colors have entirely faded into dusk.</p>

<p>45. <span class="smcap">Mayflower.</span>&mdash;<i>The Trailing Arbutus.</i></p>

<p>48. <span class="smcap">The Ghost Flower.</span>&mdash;The <i>monotropa uniflora</i>,&mdash;a
true flower, not a fungus. It grows in the deep
shadows, the entire flower and stalk being colorless and
wax-like. It has white, wax-like bracts in place of green
leaves. The cup nods, and stalk and flower together
often form an interrogation point (which fact, it will be
observed, determines the cast of the sonnet). The flower
is widely known as the Ghost Flower, but is often called
Indian Pipe.</p>

<p>52. <span class="smcap">McMaster University.</span>&mdash;Founded as a distinctively
Christian university, by the late William
McMaster, of Toronto, merchant, founder of the Bank
of Commerce, and a member of the Senate of the
Dominion of Canada.</p>

<p>54. <i>Areopagus ... Furies.</i>&mdash;The sessions of the
Areopagus, the highest judicial court at Athens, were
held on Mars' Hill. The Cave of the Furies was
beneath the same rock.</p>

<p>66. <i>And shewed the prints of palfrey's shoe.</i>&mdash;These
tiny horse-shoe prints, many of them sharp and perfect
even to the nail-heads, may be seen in abundance on the
branches of any horse-chestnut tree.</p>

<p>82. <i>Had I two loaves of bread</i>,&mdash;Mohammed. <i>Or let
me die</i>&mdash;Wordsworth,&mdash;uttered in view of his emotion at
the sight of the rainbow.</p>

<p>84. <span class="smcap">The Dragonfly.</span>&mdash;The species of neuropterous
insects referred to in the poem deposit their eggs in
water. The grub lives at the bottom of the lake or
pond, creeping on the submerged parts of aquatic plants
and feeding on aquatic insects. When the final transformation
is about to take place, the body of the insect
becomes swollen until, lighter than the water, it rises to
the surface. As its skin dries, it splits at the back, and
the perfect insect comes forth, with body and wings quite
soft and moist. When dry, the wings expand, until
presently the insect spreads them, and soaring upwards,
begins to dart to and fro in the full enjoyment of its new
and wondrous life.</p>

<p>115. <i>The moon at her utmost poised.</i>&mdash;The moon is in
meridian at high water in the Bay of Fundy.</p>

<p>159. <span class="smcap">"By the Love": An Easter Idyll.</span>&mdash;The
story on which this poem is founded was published in
the <i>Congregationalist</i>, by Helen Strong Thompson, as a
true incident of the Easter of 1894.</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
